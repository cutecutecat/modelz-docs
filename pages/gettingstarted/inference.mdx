# Make Predictions

This page will show you how to make predictions using your deployments.

## Use the Modelz SDK

The easiest way to make predictions is to use the Modelz SDK.

For example, if you have deployed a Deployment `a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9` and you want to make a prediction using the Modelz SDK, you could run the following code:

``` python copy
# pip install modelz-py
import modelz

apiKey = "mzi-abcdefg..."

cli = modelz.ModelzClient(api_key=apiKey, project="a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9")
cli.inference(params={}, timeout=10)
```

## Use the `curl` command

You could also use the `curl` command to make predictions.

For example, if you have deployed a Deployment `a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9` and you want to make a prediction using the `curl` command, you could run the following command:

```bash copy
curl --location 'http://cloud.modelz.ai/api/v1/mosec/inference/a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9.{UID}/inference' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-API-Key: mzi-abcdefg...' \
--data '{
    ...
}'
```
