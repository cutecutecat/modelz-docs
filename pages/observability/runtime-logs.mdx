# Runtime Logs

Runtime logs include the inference server logs, and the logs from your inference code.

The logs interface provides an easy way to debug your inference code. You can view the logs for each replica, and filter the logs by log level.

We will show every log message that is generated by your inference code. Each log message contains the following information:

- Project: The ID of the project.
- Replica: The ID of the replica.
- Timestamp: The timestamp of the log message.
- Text: The log message.

You could view the logs on the dashboard, or you could use the [**API**](../api-reference) to get the logs.
