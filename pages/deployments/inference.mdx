# Make Predictions

This page will show you how to make predictions using your deployments.

## Use the Modelz SDK

The easiest way to make predictions is to use the Modelz SDK.

For example, if you have deployed a Deployment `a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9` and you want to make a prediction using the Modelz SDK, you could run the following code:

``` python copy
```

## Use the `curl` command

You could also use the `curl` command to make predictions.

For example, if you have deployed a Deployment `a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9` and you want to make a prediction using the `curl` command, you could run the following command:

``` copy
curl -X POST \
  http://api.modelz.ai/inference/a2a4bb7d-2899-4472-a3b4-ee69f04650a9/inference \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'token here' \
  -d '{
    "data": {
        "ndarray": [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
    }
}'
```
