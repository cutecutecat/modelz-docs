# Autoscaler

The autoscaler scales [**Deployment**](./deployment) horizontally between a minimum and maximum number of replicas, or to zero.

You can configure the autoscaler to scale based on the number of concurrent requests. Configuration options are shown here:

- `min_replicas`: Minimum number of replicas to scale to. Defaults to 0.
- `max_replicas`: Maximum number of replicas to scale to. Defaults to 1.
- `target_load`: Ideal number of concurrent requests per replica. Defaults to 5.
- `zero_duration`: Idle duration before scaling to zero. Defaults to 30 seconds.

## Examples

Let's say `min_replicas` is 0, `max_replicas` is 2, and `target_load` is 5. This means that you have a model that can handle 5 concurrent requests per replica. 

The replicas will be 0 when there are no requests, and will scale up to 1 when there are 1 concurrent requests. If there are 6 concurrent requests, the replicas will scale up to 2. And after 30 seconds of no requests, the replicas will scale down to 0.

## Configure the Autoscaler

These options are available in the [**Deployment**](./deployment). You could configure them in the dashboard.
